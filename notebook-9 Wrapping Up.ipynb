    "Have you ever thought about how and where files are stored on your computer? Probably not, unless you were very bored.

    "\n",
    "In the Terminal video just above you'll have seen several seemingly cryptic commands -- we'll examine them in more detail below, but the important ones to note in this video are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ls` lists the contents of the current directory\n",
    "- `cd` changes from the current directory\n",
    "\n",
    "### Navigating Using the Terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to think of the terminal as having a 'location in' or a 'view of' your computer: it's the same as clicking through the Finder (or Windows Explorer) in that you have to move 'down' into sub-folders or 'up' into parent directories to see what's available at that 'level' of the drive. \n",
    "\n",
    "So in the movie you've just watched:\n",
    "1. I started the movie while in a directory called `KCL Teaching` that (you see at the end) sits under `/Users/my.blurred.username/Documents/`.\n",
    "2. I listed the files and directories in `KCL Teaching` using `ls`.\n",
    "3. I then changed directory (using `cd`) into the directory called `KCL Modules` (and note that, because there's a space in the directory name I had to write this as `KCL\\ Modules`... that's because the Terminal couldn't otherwise tell if we meant to move to a directory called `KCL` and then run a command called `Modules`; it's a long story).\n",
    "4. I then changed directory again into a directory called `Undergraduate` -- if you're keeping track this now means that we're 'in' `/Users/my.blurred.username/Documents/KCL\\ Teaching/KCL\\ Modules/Undergraduate/`\n",
    "5. We carry on navigating down the hierarchy until we reach the 2017-18 teaching folder, at which point I print the working directory to show you where we've ended up and that it's the same location as we reached using the Finder in the other video. \n",
    "\n",
    "For people who are used to just saving a document pretty much anywhere on their computer (or iPad or iPhone) and having it accessible via Spotlight/Search functions this can take a _lot_ of getting used to, but remember that in learning to program we're gradually stripping away the bells and whistles that sit between you and what the computer's actually doing.

    "### The Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning to program involves a _lot_ of delayed gratification: you will need to invest quite a bit of time in learning to crawl before you can walk, and walk before you can run. A well-designed programming language like Python can make it easier to learn each step, but it still won't make it easy. We've said this before and we'll say it again (and again, and again) that you _must_ think of this as learning a language: at first very little will make sense and you won't be able to say much more than 'hello, my name is X', but if you _practice_ and really _think_ about what you're doing it will get easier and easier, and faster and faster, to program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning to navigate around your hard drive using the Terminal is a good case in point: why learn to do this when you could just dump all of your data into one directory and then never need to think about it again? \n",
    "\n",
    "Two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Because you will need to think _logically_ and in an _organised_ way about how you manage data when you start doing data analysis: you will almost never receive raw data that doesn't require some work; so if you save your raw data and your processed data in the same directory how can you be sure you've loaded the right file? It's much easier to have two folders -- `raw` or `source`, and `clean` or `output` -- and use Python to read in raw data from one directory and writing the processed data out to a different directory than it would be using Excel's `File > Save As`. That's because the path is just a _string_ and you can easily work with it as an array like any other!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Because once you've learned how to use the path on your _own_ computer, you can use the _same_ techniques to navigate a web server or computer on the other side of the planet using URLs (which are just paths with some special 'sauce' that tell Python that the file it needs isn't on this computer).\n",

    "We're going to revisit a lot of this as part of the next module, but just to highlight a few things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We got a CSV file from somewhere using `requests` (I don't even know where GitHub's servers are based),\n",
    "2. We 'parsed' it into a list (each `row` becomes a list thanks to the magic of the `csv` library that we `import`),\n",
    "3. We skip the first row (because it's a 'header' row and doesn't contain data),\n",

    "### Special Paths\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there are a few 'special' paths that you need to know about when using the Terminal or Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `/` is the **root directory** (so `cd /` would take you to the 'root' of the hard drive)\n",
    "- `~` is the **home directory** (this is a shortcut: it's the same as typing `cd /Users/myusername/`)\n",
    "- `.` means the **current directory** (this is avoid ambiguity: `cd ./myusername/Documents` would assume that in the current directory there is a sub-directory called `Documents` under `myusername`)\n",
    "- `..` means the **next directory up** (this is so that you don't have to type out `cd /Users/myusername/Settings` just to go from `Documents` 'over' to `Settings`; instead, you can use `cd ../Settings/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of terminology: any path that starts with a `/` is an _**absolute path**_ because we are starting from the _**root**_ directory; any path that starts with either `..` or `.` is a _**relative path**_ because it is starting from the _**current**_ directory and is relative to where the Terminal or program 'is' now.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Windows vs Everyone Else\n",
    "\n",
    "For historical reasons, Windows has long been just a bit different from Unix/Linux/Mac in how paths are specified: on Windows it has long been the case that the path separator was `\\`, not `/` (`:` also isn't allowed in file name on a Mac for historical reasons)!\n",
    "\n",
    "So the following Unix/Mac path: `/Users/myusername/Documents/`\n",
    "\n",
    "On a Windows machine would usually be: `\\Users\\myusername\\Documents\\`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you remember that on a Unix/Mac we use `\\` to manage things like spaces in a directory name then you can see how it gets pretty confusing and complicated pretty quickly when you start to program... But in Python we can cope with _both_ of these situations and others using the `os` library (short for 'operating system'); see the examples below!\n",

    "| Command | Short For... | What It Does |\n",
    "|:------- |:------------ |:------------ |\n",

    "| cd | change directory | Move to the path I'm about to give you ('`cd ~`' moves you to your home directory; '`cd ..`' moves you to the parent directory; etc.) | \n",
    "| pwd | print working directory | Show the path of the current current directory (_i.e._ where am I now?) |\n",
    "| head | Get the head of a file | Print the first few lines of the specified file (_e.g._ `head somefile.csv`) |\n",
    "| tail | Get the tail of a file | Print the last few lines of the specified file (_e.g._ `tail -n 2 somefile.csv`) |\n",
    "| clear | Clear the Terminal | When the Terminal looks really busy with junk you don't need just type `clear` |\n",
    "| exit | Exit the Terminal | To close an open Terminal window |\n",
    "| mv | Move a directory or file | Like dragging things in the Finder window (_e.g._ `mv somefile.csv ../another_dir/` to move the file `somefile.csv` _over_ to a directory named `another_dir` that is accessible from the parent directory of this one) |\n",
    "| cp | Copy a directory or file | Like dragging things in the Finder window (_e.g._ `cp somefile.csv ../another_dir/` to make a copy of the file `somefile.csv` in a directory named `another_dir` that is accessible from the parent directory of this one) |\n",

    "## Style\n",
    "\n",
    "As with any other type of creative writing -- make no mistake, writing code is a creative activity! -- different people have different styles of writing. Extending the language metaphor, different programming languages have different styles as well and you can often tell what programming language someone learned first (or best) by the way they write their code in _any_ programming language. While it's _nice_ to work in the style that is considered 'best' in each language, what is more important is that you are consistent in how you write: that way, another person reading your code can get used to the way that you write and make better sense of what you're trying to do.\n",

    "\n",
    "| Variable Name | Language | Rationale |\n",
    "|:--------------|:---------|:----------|\n",
    "| my_variable | Python, Perl | Underscores (\"\\_\") make it easy to read 'words' in a variable name |\n",
    "| MyVariable | Java | Mixed Caps makes for shorter variable names that are easier to type |\n",
    "| my.variable | R | R allows full-stops in variable names, no other language does |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "Commenting code that they've written is something that programmers normally hate doing, because it's not _doing_ work after all... until you have to try to understand what you've done and why two days or two months later. You'd be surprised how quickly your memory of _why_ you did something one way, and not another, will fade and, with it, the risks that you were trying to avoid. It doesn't matter how clear your variable names are (_e.g._ `url_to_get` or `do_not_do_this`) you will eventually forget what is going on. Comments help you to avoid this, and they also allow you to write more concise, efficient code because your variable and function names don't have to do all the heavy lifting of explanation as well!\n",
    "\n",
    "How to comment well:\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are as many ways of commenting well as there are ways of writing code well -- the point is to be clear and consistent.\n",
    "- You might think of adding a _short_ comment on the end of a line of code if that line is doing something complex and not immediately obvious:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import random\n",
    "random.seed(123456789) # For reproducibility\n",
    "```\n",
    "- You might think of adding a one-line or multi-line comment at the start of a _block_ of code that is achieving something specific:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create a new data frame to \n",
    "# hold the percentage values\n",
    "# and initialise it with only\n",
    "# the 'mnemonic' (i.e. GeoCode)\n",
    "d_pct = pd.concat(\n",
    "    [d[t]['mnemonic']], \n",
    "    axis=1, \n",
    "    keys=['mnemonic'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "- You might think of using some formatting for a long _section_ of code that forms a key stage of your analysis:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "##############################\n",
    "# This next section deals with\n",
    "# extracting data from the \n",
    "# London Data Store and tidying\n",
    "# up the values so that they work\n",
    "# with pandas.\n",
    "##############################\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Finally, you can also use multi-line strings as a kind of comment format:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "=========================================================\n",
    "Extract pd2-level data from the price paid medians data\n",
    "=========================================================\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Many programmers will mix all of these different styles together, but they will do so in a consistent way: the more complex the formatting and layout of the comment, the larger the block of code to which the comment applies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Style Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "As we said at the start, style matters because it makes your code _intelligible_ to you, and to others. For professional programmers that is incredibly important because almost no one works on their own any more: applications are too complex for one programmer to get very far. So programmers need others to be able to read and interpret the code that they've written. As well, you might be asked to (or want to) go back to make changes to some code that you wrote some time ago -- if you've not commented your code or used a consistent style you're much more likely to break things. You might have heard of the Facebook motto \"Move fast and break things\" -- that doesn't refer to Facebook's web application, it refers to _paradigms_. \n",

    "## Why???\n",
    "\n",
    "We'd like to wrap up Code Camp by revisiting the question of 'why' -- why invest a lot of time and energy in learning to code? There are a host of reasons, but we'd like to pick out a few of the ones that we think are most important for undergraduate students:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Coding teaches logical thinking: right from the start, coding reinforces logical thinking. A computer will try to do _exactly_ what you say, regardless of how inappropriate or illogical that statement might be. To become a better programmer you will need to develop a good idea of what you're trying to achieve, the steps involved in getting there, and you'll need an eye for detail as well since `my_variable` is not the same as `myvariable`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Coding teaching abstraction: this might seem a bit of a strange point coming right after the one about an 'eye for detail', but it's true! Writing code is not just about solving for one row of data, or 1,000, it's about solving the problem in a _general_ way: mapping and analysis tools like [PySAL](http://pysal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or [Folium](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium) weren't create to solve one mapping or spatial analysis problem, but a _range_ of them! Well-written code is easy to adapt and re-use (and in follow-on classes we'll look at how to encapsulate useful snippets of code in functions so that it's even easier) because you aren't just thinking about \"I have to process population data for 20 English cities\" but about \"How do I manage population data in many different formats about cities anywhere in the world?\". You also need to have, in your head, a high-level _model_ of how the computer is processing the data so that you can frame your solution appropriately. Again, that's abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Coding is scalable: there's a lot of 'start-up cost' involved with a coding solution, but once you get over this hump it's highly scalable. One of us has been working on a Machine Learning problem to try to predict gentrification in London from 2011-2021 using the period from 2001-2011. This involves not only downloading more than 30 data sets from the [ONS/NOMIS](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/) and the [London Data Store](https://data.london.gov.uk/) in order to build a model using 168 variables, it also involves making difficult choices about how to handle highly skewed data which makes accurate prediction much more difficult. Using Python, we can try _each_ of the options available and see which one work best, even though this involves reprocessing 168 variables, re-mapping 15 maps, and re-outputting 3 data files for use in QGIS. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Coding is replicable: the 'crisis of replicability' has enormous implications for medicine, psychology, policy, planning, and environmental science. Without the ability to check how data was collected, processed, and analysed we are basically 'flying blind'. You might have heard about the [Excel error used to justify austerity](http://theconversation.com/economists-an-excel-error-and-the-misguided-push-for-austerity-13584) or about the [crisis in replicability](http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/the-crisis-in-social-psychology-that-isnt)? Or that only [positive trials](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trial-sans-error-how-pharma-funded-research-cherry-picks-positive-results/) of a drug are published? These are parts of a larger debate within the sciences about how much of the scientific process should be conducted 'in the open' -- is it just data? or is it code as well? Increasingly, journals and scientists are arguing for it to be both.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Coding is empowering: if you stick with it you'll probably find that, one afternoon, you start coding around 3pm and suddenly realise that it's dark out, you're hungry, and you've been coding non-stop all the way to 9pm! We don't recommend this as everyday practice, but it's a sign of how engaging coding can be, how easy it is to enter '[flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology))', and how exciting it can be to solve real problems and achieve a real output. Ultimately, we think that 'bending' a computer to your will -- and, as importantly, figuring out how to frame a human problem in logical terms that a computer can handle -- is a tremendously empowering experience: that day you click 'run' or hit 'enter' and the computer chews away at a data set for 10 seconds or 10 hours **and** comes back to you with a solution to your problem is profoundly thrilling because it means that you've done work that _works_ on multiple levels simultaneously (it works at the fine-scale of syntax _and_ at the conceptual level of design).\n",
    "\n",
    "We hope you'll get there and we hope you'll stick it out until you do! If you invest the time and effort then we're pretty confident that _any_ of you can become a competent programmer: but don't take our word for it, ask some of this year's Third Years what they think! And here is some more food for thought:\n",
